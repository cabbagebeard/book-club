# Book Club
- I am building a Rails application that is to be used for group discussion of books. A club will have one or many people in charge of choosing a new reading for the club, as well as creating meaningful topics for group members to discuss. 
- This app will feature book data from Goodreads API and OAuth through Facebook


# To do:
- mobile responsive
- Club admin panel
- New books
